### Translation Examples (v0.2.0)

**Before (generic dictionary):**
```
大监狱 → big prison
4=1 → four equals one
速刷 → fast brush
```

**After (WoW context-aware):**
```
大监狱 → Karazhan (KZ) weekly quest
4=1 → 4 items reserved for 1 player (loot rule)
速刷 → speed run
来T → need tank
许愿 → reserve (loot)
科技 → optimized build/player
```

## Installation

### Method 1: Manual Install
1. Download the latest release
2. Extract to `World of Warcraft/Interface/AddOns/`
3. Restart WoW or type `/reload`

### Method 2: Git Clone
```bash
cd "World of Warcraft/Interface/AddOns/"
git clone https://github.com/sanjaygbhat/TWoW-Translate.git TranslateWoW
